<h2>The Brief</h2>
<h2 class="post-header__client"><span class="post-header__info post-header__info--client">Client: </span>{{ page.client }}</h2>
<p>Working with the Foundry's leadership, our goal was to communicate the Foundry's capacity to empower individuals to create whatever they can imagine with the resources and communal knowledge available.</p>

<h3>The Logo</h3>
<p>As the cornerstone of the Foundry's visual identity, the new logo was the first asset to be created. In addition to clarity of communication, versatility was a crucial concern for the logo. It was important to create a mark that could be fabricated with any of the tools available at the Foundry.</p>

<p class="caption">Initial logo drafts.</p>
<p>Initial iterations focused on imagery analagous to tools, manufacturing, physics, and electricity. Departing further, we explored imagery related to the concept of ideas.</p>

<p class="caption">Refined drafts exploring the lightbulb.</p>
<p>The second round of drafts was more abstract, to avoid imagery that would be too narrowly focused upon specific creative processes. These drafts attempted to communicate ideas and community at a more conceptual level.</p>

<p class="caption">The final logo.</p>
<p>The final logo takes off on the analogy of the lightbulb as the idea, while the hexagon represents hive-like community.</p>

<p>The logo and wordmark lockup further emphasizes idea as a core component of the Foundry's mission.</p>

<h3>Typography</h3>
<p>The maker community values open-source, and so does the Columbus Idea Foundry. As such, in developing the type pallete, Source Sans Pro was selected as the workhorse, supplemented by League Gothic for emphasis.</p>

<h3>Print Collateral</h3>
<p>Evergreen print collateral was also developed as part of the new visual identity. I worked this through from concept through creation, including some contributions to the copy.</p>
