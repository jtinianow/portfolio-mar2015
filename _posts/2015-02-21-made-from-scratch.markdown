From spring of 2012 until now, I’ve gone from student to professional, back to student. Switching between these roles, I’ve become aware of a crucial difference between them. As a professional, I can (and must) be very efficient, always bringing on new projects, always delivering by a hard deadline. As a student, the rules aren’t as strict. I can be slow and make mistakes, and at the end of the day it’s a learning experience.

As a student, I have the freedom to do things the long, hard, stupid way. Don’t get me wrong, I care about the work I do as a student. And it’s not that I enjoy making mistakes, simply that I’ve found a lot of value in the freedom to screw up, throw it away, and start over again.

I’m a big fan of the hard reset. I’ve learned that if it takes me ten hours to build version one, I can do version two from scratch in four, and version three in two. It’s no that I learn that fast, it’s more that by starting with the “everything from scratch” mentality forces me to consider and account for every factor, and more importantly to find opportunities in the hurdles.

### And Then There Are Side Projects.

I’ve always thought that student status was a sort of permission slip that allowed me to take a break from the real world and slow down. But I’ve realized that, even in my own experience, the student/professional dichotomy is a false one. Frank Chimero exemplifies the long, hard, stupid approach to professional work (and explains the idea beautifully).

### Thank You Cards

A couple of years ago, when I was a struggling freelancer and nobody was paying me, I decided that side projects might be a good way to keep the stress from ruining my day. I’d read some of Jessica Hische’s thoughts on procrastiworking and the benefit of side projects. More recently, the folks at Crew published an article on the subject of how launching Unsplash saved them from going out of business.

So I needed something to focus on, and I’ve always been interested in printmaking. I never had time to take a course in undergrad. Now I found myself with far too much free time, and access to the Columbus Idea Foundry’s 30,000 square foot makerspace.

I decided that this was a great opportunity to get into something that I’d been interested in. I even knew what I was going print: thank you cards. Figuring you can never have too many, I sketched out my design and got ready to print it.

### Pay to Play

There was just one catch: printmaking is expensive. For someone who doesn’t already own the equipment, the barrier to entry is pretty high (I later got into screen printing, but only with the help of grant from the Greater Columbus Arts Council).

The hacker culture and DIY ethic that surrounded me at the Idea Foundry pushed to figure out some way that I could take on printmaking without a large budget.

### Opensource Saves The Day

I forget how I came upon the term “bottle jack printing press,” but one Google search and I was set. Long time printmaker Charles Morgan published his plans for a printing press that you can build for less than $150, and conveniently, I already had access to a full woodshop and plenty of scrap material to work with.

### …But That Doesn’t Mean It Was Easy

I set out to build the press, and with the help of a couple friends, was up and running in about a day and a half. Then everything went downhill. I had spent just about all I had on the press, which left no funds for ink, linoleum, or paper. I was stuck with what I could scrounge up: crap quality ink, thin paper, and (luckily) one piece of lino I had in the basement.

I had decided to see if I could make a printing plate by laser etching the linoleum. There was no way I could afford to have a proper plate made, and I already had access to the Foundry’s laser cutter. Needless, to say, laser etching seemed like an easy option. As it turns out, very few printmakers have used this technique. It was difficult to find any information about exactly how to cut the plate without ruining it. (As a note, this was several years ago, and there’s quite a bit more information out there on this technique now).

Eventually, I was able to get in touch a designer by the name of Robin Hanhart who had been playing with this technique. He gave me some point pointers and it looked like smooth sailing was ahead.

As it turns out, low grade water-based ink doesn’t do too well in a high humidity environment like the one I was printing in. Now I had a plate and a press, but everything I tried to print would refuse to dry and ended up smudged beyond the charming point of “that handmade look”.

It looked like I had just wasted the last week and the last of my money on some stupid endeavor that wouldn’t pay off. I started thinking, “if I needed Thank You cards, why didn’t I just go pick some up at the store?” Suffice to say, this experience was not what you would call “positive”.

I had to put my little printmaking idea on the back burner for a while, and focus on other things. I felt foolish and as if the whole thing was a waste.

### Making Something Is Never A Waste Of Time

Yes, there is a happy ending to this story. After giving up on my silly little side project, I met Scott Moore, an expert printmaker who joined the Idea Foundry to laser cut his own wood type. I showed him my press and the laser-etched plate, and we were off. Scott gave me not only great advice, but a couple jars of nice rubber-based ink to play with.

Reinvigorated, I got back to the press and gave it a whirl. This time, success. Within an hour I had 30 Thank You cards, hand-lettered and hand-printed on a handmade printing press.

These cards didn’t save my freelance business, they didn’t spinoff into a line of profitable products, and I’ve since left the press behind. The point isn’t to turn your long, hard, stupid side projects into money. The point is that sweating, struggling, and making something from scratch is rewarding in its own right. The ups and downs of creative work can be frustrating, but honestly, I wouldn’t trade anything for that moment when a long, hard, stupid project finally pays off.

### Bonus Round

I was so excited on finishing this ridiculously laborious process that I decided to immediately send out a few of the printed cards. These went out, mostly, to designers I’ve never met, but whose work and thoughts I’ve found helpful.

Most of them didn’t respond. One did.

I’ve never met James Victore, but I watch his video series from time to time, and I sent him one of my stupidly frustrating cards. About a week later, I tuned into his YouTube channel, and just about lost it when he held up the card that I printed.

That feeling was one that I couldn’t buy, and no level of efficiency could ever achieve.
