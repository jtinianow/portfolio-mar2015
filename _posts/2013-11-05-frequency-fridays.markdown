<h2>The Brief</h2>
<p>Arts and education non-profit the Fuse Factory contracted with me to create a set of print promotions for the 2013&ndash;2014 season of their music &amp; tech event series <em>Frequency Fridays</em>. The series showcases artists who make music with technology intended for other uses.</p>

<h3>The Concept</h3>
<p>To communicate the nature of the event, I developed a strategy that revolved around several illustrations of music gear with "faces".</p>

<p class="caption">Initial concept drafts.</p>
<p>The first round of drafts started to feel too visually complicated. I scaled back the shadows and got rid of some strokes to simplify the visual.</p>

<p>At this phase, I also began to play with background elements to express the varied nature and subject matter of the performances.</p>

<h3>The Refined Concept</h3>
<p>After a round of reviews, we decided to axe the gear-focues approach for the illustration, and experiment instead with robots. The goal was to emphasize the event's tech focus over the musical aspect.</p>

<p>This approach borrowed color and pattern strategy from the previous version, but incorporates a more tangible face.</p>

<h3>Final Promos</h3>
<p>The finished print pieces represent the execution of the overall strategy, using the same type of illustration on each with varying personalities for every season.</p>
