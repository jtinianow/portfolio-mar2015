## About Jeremy

Jeremy Tinianow is a cross-disciplinary designer with a focus on bridging the gap between digital and physical. Currently a student at <a href="http://bdw.colorado.edu" target="_blank">Boulder Digital Works,</a> Jeremy is on an ambiguous path with a specific goal: to explore how technology informs design, and vice versa. Here's my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/content/resume-mar2015.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>.

## About This Site

This site is an ongoing experiment. I've built it, taken it apart, and put it back together a handful of times. It's an exercise in learning new tools and it keeps me on my toes. This time I around, I've built everything with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and hosted through Github.
